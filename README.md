# Project-Nevia


# Setting
A small white planet named Tiros with life
Bright beautiful sea-weed looking plants all around taller than humans.

Creatures of different varieties, and some with minor intelligence.
These Intelligent beings on this planet are called Saiquet’s.

# Characters
 Saiquet’s are our main protagonists from the planet Tiros.
Saiquet’s look like bright floating beings that harness the immense star energy from their planet.
 
The star energy that is used from their home planet can be converted into a state of creation.

Saiquets only need to do this every 16 months in order to survive. Each month that go goes by they dim and get weaker and eventually die.


Domorios said to be the brother star of Tiros. Has dark and deep obscured lands that hold life in which feed off of the dark energy of the planet.

# Plot

The two planet’s Tiros and Denithios are parents of a star from beginning creations of their existence and are the two remaining planet’s from that particular parent star.

The two stars are drawn into each other over the millennia. 3 months  after the two planets are close enough to the point to cause an epidemic reaction that causes the dark planet to break off pieces of the planet. These pieces are being pulled by the entire planet Tiros. Due to the positive and negative energy impact of the planets gradually getting closer. Eventually their planet’s will have a strong enough pull that will collide and rip both planets apart.

Saiquets try to protect and fix their home planet from the hellish rabid creatures that end up on their planet from the meteors that were pulled in from Domorios.


# The Beginning

  
  Astria the mother star that was born with dark and light energy. These two energies soon shattered from Astria leaving the celestial energy. However, as time goes on the dark and light energy from the two planets soon form into their own planets. When separated from the planet Astria they were both shot in opposite directions. The two sides of Astria had formed into their own planets. These planet’s decades later emit life being born.

  Many species sore through this planet and walk its grounds. There is even a minor species that protect, and harness the energy from their planet. This is the planet Tiros, know as the light star. This particular species harness the energy in order to survive and can even control this energy and create with it. These living beings are called saiquets. They are what bring beauty and creation to their planet. These beings can float at a certain degree but can choose to walk their planet. They are bright creatures with light blue transparent energy ribbons that are connected to their body. These ribbons glow when harnessing or using their star energy. 

108 years later go by the two planets Tiros and Domorios are too close to the point that cause an energetic-pull between the planets. The planet Domorios is being pulled by Tiros light energy and starts to break. Small fragments of Domorios are pulled from the planet and travel to Tiros because of the energetic-pull. Soon in time when the meteors come to Tiros atmosphere they land on the planet. Cause large dark spots on their planet. When near these spots the Saiquets energy is almost unusable. Some of these meteors have carried living beings from Domorios over to Tiros cause major confliction. The enraged rabid beings of Domorios are loose upon Tiros and consume many of the species that live their. Taking in Tiros star energy enrages the dark star energy of Domorios causes them to keep consuming them. 



Unlike saiquets they use this energy ,but rather to create, they destroy. Not knowing how to control the energy it rather released recklessly causing massive damage around. Soon the saiquets take action into controlling the situation, using their abilities to entrap and control the species to cause further harm. The saiquets try to save their home from this major epidemic but has even bigger issues to face in order to save their entire planet.

And they live happy for the days to come
