## Scene 1

Large plains, plants, tall plants etc.
Bright Sky, bright setting. 
Flowing particle patches on certain plants.
Smooth, leveled terrains. 

## Scene 2

Sky turns red, large glowing red & black planet in the sky.
Objects start to fall down on the planet Tiros.
Crash sites appear. Crash sites create large craters in the ground emitting dark energy and causing the terrain to change.
At the crash sites, the corrupted beings start to spawn at the site attacking.

## Scene 3

The corrupted creatures are destroyed and have all be exterminated off the planet.
Domorios is really close to Tiros causing the skys to turn very dark. 
The saiquets need to find a way to stop the planet from getting closer and try to send it farther away.

They then use the dark energy spots to their benefit and for a short limited they use this dark energy to convert their 
planets energy into dark energy making their energy force the same as Domorois causing a great energy push between Tiros and Domorios.

The two planets begin to push away from eachother till it's energetic pull is to far to be pulled by Tiros again.
Once done, the planets have reverted back to normal from removing the energy spots from Tiros.
